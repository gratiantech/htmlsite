      <h1>Fawcett Comics</h1>
      <p>One of the most successful comic book publisher in the 1940's, Fawcett Publications 
         began in 1919 with the magazine, <cite>Captain Billy's Whiz Bang</cite>. Its total
         circulation from all of its publications eventually reached over 10 million issues
         a month.</p>
      <p>Fawcett is best known for its popular superhero, Captain Marvel, based on the
         adventures of radio reporter Billy Batson who would turn into Captain Marvel
         upon uttering the word <em>Shazam!</em>. Other successful characters include
         Ibis the Invincible, Hopalong Cassidy, and Mister Scarlet. Fawcett was also known 
         for its series of horror comics including <cite>Beware! Terror Tales</cite>, 
         <cite>Worlds of Fear</cite>, and <cite>Strange Suspense Stories</cite>. The
         company branched out into humor comic magazines with <cite>Otis and Babs</cite> 
         and <cite>Hoppy the Marvel Bunny</cite> among its most popular titles.</p>
      <p>Facing declining sales, Fawcett Comics ceased publication of its superhero
         titles in 1953. Several of its titles were eventually sold to Charlton
         Comics.</p>
